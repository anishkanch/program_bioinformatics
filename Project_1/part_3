# The commands in your submitted script create a variable called wizard and an alias called view_wizard which prints the contents of the wizard variable. Consider a situation in which the value stored in "wizard" may change (e.g., to "Radagast the Brown"). 

# (1) Describe function performed by quotes when creating the alias. 
When quotes are used during the creation of an alias, it allows Bash to view the entire contents of the code in one segment. If quotes were not used, the variable listed (in our case this would be wizard) would be expanded before the echo command is utlized and the alias is created. Thus, Bash would view the line as echo followed by the value of wizard, giving you an error. In our case, the alias would be viewed as "echo Gandalf the Grey", causing an error as the entire line is not viewed as one cohesive unit. An error would occur because Bash would begin trying to assign "echo", "Gandalf", "the", and "Grey" all as values to "view_wizard." 

# (2) Is there a difference in the behavior of the alias if you create the alias using single quotes or double quotes? If so, explain the difference. If not, why not?
Yes, there is a difference between the usage of single quotes or double quotes in the creation of an alias. If single quotes are used such as (alias view_wizard='echo "$wizard"'), if the value of "wizard" is changed later on to a value such as "Radagast the Brown", this change would be reflected when "view_wizard" is ran later (view_wizard will return the same as echo $wizard). However, if double quotes are used such as (alias view_wizard="echo "$wizard""), "view_wizard" will return the original value (Gandalf the Grey) even if the value of "wizard" is changed to "Radagast the Brown". "view_wizard" will NOT return the same as echo $wizard.
